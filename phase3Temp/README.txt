The parser directory contains all parser files.

Testcases were created to test each implemented feature. The differences between the files from the first phase and the second phase are included as well with their respective diff names. The majority of the changes took place in parser.ssl.

The Phase2Documentation.docx file contains a description of the edits made to any file, coupled with justification and explanation of the changes made. Supplementary information can be found in  the Diff Files, and furthermore the outputs from the tests along with the files that were run to produce the output.
