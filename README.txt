The parser directory contains all parser files.

The testSuite directory contains 40 test cases, the scanner input and output for each test case in a .txt file, and the bash script that generates the .txt files.

The Phase1Documentation.pdf file contains a description of the edits made to any file, coupled with justification and explanation of the changes made. Supplementary information can be found in  the files IdentifiersDiff.txt, parserPtDiff.txt, ScandefDiff.txt and scanDiff.txt. These files are the direct output of the diff command being run on stdIdentifiers, parser.pt, scan.def and scan.ssl, respectively.
