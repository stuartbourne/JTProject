The semantic directory contains all appropriate files, the files semantic.ssl and semantic.pt were where the majority of changes took place. semantic.pt is where all of the tables are defined, the semantic mechanisms are implmented, and the error messages are defined and output. semantic.ssl is where all the ssl rules depicting the behaviour of the semantic analysis are defined.

Testcases were created to test each implemented feature. A shell script was created to emit the output from running each of the test files and compare the output to the one generated by running the professor's solution. The majority of the changes took place in semantic.ssl, and the respective semantic operations were defined in semantic.pt.

The Phase3Documentation.docx file contains a description of the edits made to any file, coupled with justification and explanation of the changes made. Supplementary information can be found in semanticDiff.Diff and semanticPTDiff.diff in the DiffFiles directory, and furthermore the outputs from the tests along with the files themselves, found in the directory outputDir, these outputs were generated by the written shell script p3.sh.

If the diff files and the generated outputs are analyzed, it can be seen that the majority of our ouputs are nearly identical to the professors solution. However, when encountering an assignment statement, there is an error somewhere in either semantic.ssl or semantic.pt which will not allow variables to be asssigned. This resulted in the inability to check the implemented logic for multiple statements, which may be the primary reason for errors in the project.
