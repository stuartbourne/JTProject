The coderlinux subdirectory under the parent directory ptsrc contains all modified files. The files coder.ssl and coder.pt were where the majority of changes took place. coder.pt is where all of the tables are defined, the semantic mechanisms are implmented, and the error messages are defined and output. coder.ssl is where all the ssl rules depicting the behaviour of the code generation phase are defined.

Testcases were created to test each implemented feature. A shell script (testall.sh) was created to emit the output from running each of the test files and compare the output to the one generated by running the professor's solution. The majority of the changes took place in coder.ssl, and the respective semantic operations were defined in coder.pt.

The Phase4Documentation.docx file contains a description of the edits made to any file, coupled with justification and explanation of the changes made. Supplementary information can be found in the coderDef.Diff, coderSSL.diff and coderPt.diff in the DiffFiles directory. 

Outputs from the tests along with the files themselves, found in the directory jt_progs. Each sample program within jt_progs is accompanied by a seperate directory containing the extensive ssltrace from our compiler, as well as the professor's compiler. Additionally, the assembled and compiled code can be found within this directory.

If the diff files and the generated outputs are analyzed, it can be seen that the majority of our ouputs are nearly identical to the professors solution. However, null strings cause a program to crash.
