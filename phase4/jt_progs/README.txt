This directory contains some real example JT programs 
to try your solutions out on.  They are not intended to 
be a test set, and are insufficient to fully test your solutions.

However, they are interesting real examples of JT programs 
that your solutions should be able to handle.

The .ssltrace-tN-e files are the result of an S/SL trace of 
the output of phase N of the instructor's solution when compiling
the program. The .s files are the assembly language output of 
the code generator of the instructor's solution.  If you are stuck 
with a problem in any phase, it may be interesting to compare the 
output of your solution to these.

The examples in the subdirectory 858only/ are an additional set
of programs using valued functions, as required for 858.
